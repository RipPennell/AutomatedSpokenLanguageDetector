A model has been trained on thousands of hours of speech data. When you record yourself or someone else speaking, it will detect the language being spoken. Speaking for longer will help with the accuracy, up to 10 seconds.

Currently detectable languages are currently English, French, Arabic, German, Persian, Russian, and Chinese (China).
